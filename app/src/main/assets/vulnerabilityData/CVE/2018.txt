CVE-2018-0732 : During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).

This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).

CVE-2018-1000005 : libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.

Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.

CVE-2018-1000030 : Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.

CVE-2018-10183 : An issue was discovered in BigTree 4.2.22. There is cross-site scripting (XSS) in /core/inc/lib/less.php/test/index.php because of a $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] echo, as demonstrated by the dir parameter in a file=charsets action.
CVE-2018-10184 : An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 frame length was checked against the max_frame_size setting instead of being checked against the bufsize. The max_frame_size only applies to outgoing traffic and not to incoming, so if a large enough frame size is advertised in the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame will be defragmented into a temporary allocated buffer where the second fragment may overflow the heap by up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this can be exploited for code execution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses not realistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediate crash is absolutely certain.
CVE-2018-10185 : An issue was discovered in TuziCMS v2.0.6. There is a CSRF vulnerability that can add an admin account, as demonstrated by a history.pushState call.
CVE-2018-10186 : In radare2 2.5.0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the r_hex_bin2str function (libr/util/hex.c). Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted DEX file. This issue is different from CVE-2017-15368.
CVE-2018-10187 : In radare2 2.5.0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the dalvik_op function (libr/anal/p/anal_dalvik.c).

CVE-2018-10188 : phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 before 4.8.0-1 has CSRF, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements, related to js/db_operations.js, js/tbl_operations.js, libraries/classes/Operations.php, and sql.php.
CVE-2018-10189 : An issue was discovered in Mautic 1.x and 2.x before 2.13.0. It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.
CVE-2018-1019 : A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge, aka "Chakra Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability." This affects Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2018-0979, CVE-2018-0980, CVE-2018-0990, CVE-2018-0993, CVE-2018-0994, CVE-2018-0995.
CVE-2018-10190 : A vulnerability in London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v77 for Windows could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to run executable files with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of access controls. The "Changelog" and "Help" options available from the system tray context menu spawn an elevated instance of the user's default web browser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by selecting "Run as Administrator" from the context menu of an executable file within the file browser of the spawned default web browser. This may allow the attacker to execute privileged commands on the targeted system.
CVE-2018-10191 : In versions of mruby up to and including 1.4.0, an integer overflow exists in src/vm.c::mrb_vm_exec() when handling OP_GETUPVAR in the presence of deep scope nesting, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker that can cause Ruby code to be run can use this to possibly execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2018-10192 : IPVanish 3.0.11 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon implements an insecure XPC service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user. IPVanish uses a third-party library for converting `xpc_object_t` types in to `NSObject` types for sending XPC messages. When IPVanish establishes a new connection, the following XPC message is sent to the `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon. Because the XPC service itself does not validate an incoming connection, any application installed on the operating system can send it XPC messages. In the case of the "connect" message, an attacker could manipulate the `OpenVPNPath` to point at a malicious binary on the system. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` would receive the VPNHelperConnect command, and then execute the malicious binary as the root user.

CVE-2018-10204 : PureVPN 6.0.1 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its "sevpnclient" service. When configured to use the OpenVPN protocol, the "sevpnclient" service executes "openvpn.exe" using the OpenVPN config file located at %PROGRAMDATA%\purevpn\config\config.ovpn. This file allows "Write" permissions to users in the "Everyone" group. An authenticated attacker may modify this file to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM account.

CVE-2018-10362 : An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers.

CVE-2018-11090 : An XSS issue was discovered in MyBiz MyProcureNet 5.0.0. This vulnerability within "ProxyPage.aspx" allows an attacker to inject malicious client side scripting which will be executed in the browser of users if they visit the manipulated site.
CVE-2018-11091 : An issue was discovered in MyBiz MyProcureNet 5.0.0. A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system commands. This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the "HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter and add arbitrary extensions to the whitelist during the upload. For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the "HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter, the server accepts "secctest.asp" as a legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server.
CVE-2018-11092 : An issue was discovered in the Admin Notes plugin 1.1 for MyBB. CSRF allows an attacker to remotely delete all admin notes via an admin/index.php?empty=table (aka Clear Table) action.

CVE-2018-11101 : Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content in the reply (it doesn't matter).
CVE-2018-11102 : An issue was discovered in Libav 12.3. A read access violation in the mov_probe function in libavformat/mov.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), as demonstrated by avconv.

NOTE: the vendor indicates that the product was not intended to block this type of XSS by a user with the admin privilege.
CVE-2018-11209 : ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Z-BlogPHP 2.0.0. zb_system/cmd.php?act=verify relies on MD5 for the password parameter, which might make it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a dictionary or rainbow-table attack. NOTE: the vendor declined to accept this as a valid issue.
CVE-2018-1121 : procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.

CVE-2018-11518 : A vulnerability allows a phreaking attack on HCL legacy IVR systems that do not use VoIP. These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).

CVE-2018-11567 : ** DISPUTED ** Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard ("gibberish") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range. NOTE: The vendor states "Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do. Customers do not need to take any action for these mitigations to work."

CVE-2018-1199 : Spring Security (Spring Security 4.1.x before 4.1.5, 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 5.0.x before 5.0.1; and Spring Framework 4.3.x before 4.3.14 and 5.0.x before 5.0.3) does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.

CVE-2018-12021 : Singularity 2.3.0 through 2.5.1 is affected by an incorrect access control on systems supporting overlay file system. When using the overlay option, a malicious user may access sensitive information by exploiting a few specific Singularity features.
CVE-2018-12025 : The transferFrom function of a smart contract implementation for FuturXE (FXE), an Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to accomplish an unauthorized transfer of digital assets because of a logic error. The developer messed up with the boolean judgment - if the input value is smaller than or equal to allowed value, the transfer session would stop execution by returning false. This makes no sense, because the transferFrom() function should require the transferring value to not exceed the allowed value in the first place. Suppose this function asks for the allowed value to be smaller than the input. Then, the attacker could easily ignore the allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` would cause an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the value. The attacker could transfer any amount of FuturXe tokens of any accounts to an appointed account (the `_to` address) because the allowed value is initialized to 0, and the attacker could bypass this restriction even without the victim's private key.
CVE-2018-12026 : During the spawning of a malicious Passenger-managed application, SpawningKit in Phusion Passenger 5.3.x before 5.3.2 allows such applications to replace key files or directories in the spawning communication directory with symlinks. This then could result in arbitrary reads and writes, which in turn can result in information disclosure and privilege escalation.
CVE-2018-12027 : An Insecure Permissions vulnerability in SpawningKit in Phusion Passenger 5.3.x before 5.3.2 causes information disclosure in the following situation: given a Passenger-spawned application process that reports that it listens on a certain Unix domain socket, if any of the parent directories of said socket are writable by a normal user that is not the application's user, then that non-application user can swap that directory with something else, resulting in traffic being redirected to a non-application user's process through an alternative Unix domain socket.
CVE-2018-12028 : An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability in SpawningKit in Phusion Passenger 5.3.x before 5.3.2 allows a Passenger-managed malicious application, upon spawning a child process, to report an arbitrary different PID back to Passenger's process manager. If the malicious application then generates an error, it would cause Passenger's process manager to kill said reported arbitrary PID.
CVE-2018-12029 : A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger 3.x through 5.x before 5.3.2 allows local escalation of privileges when a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir with insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink after the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the link being chowned via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab file allows privilege escalation.
CVE-2018-1203 : In Dell EMC Isilon OneFS, the compadmin is able to run tcpdump binary with root privileges. In versions between 8.1.0.0 - 8.1.0.1, 8.0.1.0 - 8.0.1.2, and 8.0.0.0 - 8.0.0.6, the tcpdump binary, being run with sudo, may potentially be used by compadmin to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

CVE-2018-1227 : Pivotal Concourse after 2018-03-05 might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact, if a customer obtained the Concourse software from a DNS domain that is no longer controlled by Pivotal. The original domain for the Concourse CI (concourse-dot-ci) open source project has been registered by an unknown actor, and is therefore no longer the official website for Concourse CI. The new official domain is concourse-ci.org. At approximately 4 am EDT on March 7, 2018 the Concourse OSS team began receiving reports that the Concourse domain was not responding. The Concourse OSS team discovered, upon investigation with both the original and the new domain registrars, that the originating domain registrar had made the domain available for purchase. This was done despite the domain being renewed by the Concourse OSS team through August 2018. For a customer to be affected, they would have needed to access a download from a "concourse-dot-ci" domain web site after March 6, 2018 18:00:00 EST. Accessing that domain is NOT recommended by Pivotal. Anyone who had been using that domain should immediately begin using the concourse-ci.org domain instead. Customers can also safely access Concourse software from the traditionally available locations on the Pivotal Network or GitHub.

CVE-2018-1281 : The clustered setup of Apache MXNet allows users to specify which IP address and port the scheduler will listen on via the DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI and DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT env variables. In versions older than 1.0.0, however, the MXNet framework will listen on 0.0.0.0 rather than user specified DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI once a scheduler node is initialized. This exposes the instance running MXNet to any attackers reachable via the interface they didn't expect to be listening on. For example: If a user wants to run a clustered setup locally, they may specify to run on 127.0.0.1. But since MXNet will listen on 0.0.0.0, it makes the port accessible on all network interfaces.

CVE-2018-12891 : An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operations may take a long time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need to preempt the current vCPU at certain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks. By suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.
CVE-2018-12892 : An issue was discovered in Xen 4.7 through 4.10.x. libxl fails to pass the readonly flag to qemu when setting up a SCSI disk, due to what was probably an erroneous merge conflict resolution. Malicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be able to write to supposedly read-only disk images. Only emulated SCSI disks (specified as "sd" in the libxl disk configuration, or an equivalent) are affected. IDE disks ("hd") are not affected (because attempts to make them readonly are rejected). Additionally, CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always read only. Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the device model version are vulnerable. Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable. (This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.) The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.7 and later. (In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been applied, attempts to create read only disks are rejected.) If the host and guest together usually support PVHVM, the issue is exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.
CVE-2018-12893 : An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260 added some safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug exceptions. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, at least one of these safety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious PV guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied the XSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users.
CVE-2018-12895 : WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.
CVE-2018-12896 : An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random. For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system calls.

CVE-2018-13013 : Improper check of unusual conditions when launching msiexec.exe in safensec.com (SysWatch service) in SAFE'N'SEC SoftControl/SafenSoft SysWatch, SoftControl/SafenSoft TPSecure, and SoftControl/SafenSoft Enterprise Suite before 4.4.9 allows the local attacker to bypass a code-signing protection mechanism and install/execute an unauthorized program by modifying the system configuration and installing a forged MSI file. (The intended behavior is that the component SysWatch does not allow installation of MSI files unless they are signed by a limited list of certificates.)
CVE-2018-13014 : Storing password in recoverable format in safensec.com (SysWatch service) in SAFE'N'SEC SoftControl/SafenSoft SysWatch, SoftControl/SafenSoft TPSecure, and SoftControl/SafenSoft Enterprise Suite before 4.4.2 allows the local attacker to restore the SysWatch password from the settings database and modify program settings.
CVE-2018-1302 : When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.
CVE-2018-13021 : An issue was discovered in HongCMS 3.0.0. There is an Arbitrary Script File Upload issue that can result in PHP code execution via the admin/index.php/template/upload URI.
CVE-2018-13024 : Metinfo v6.0.0 allows remote attackers to write code into a .php file, and execute that code, via the module parameter to admin/column/save.php in an editor upload action.

CVE-2018-1303 : A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability.
CVE-2018-13030 : An issue was discovered in jpeg-compressor 0.1. The build_huffman function in stb_image.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.

CVE-2018-5131 : Under certain circumstances the "fetch()" API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a "no-store" or "no-cache" cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5132 : The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as "about:debugging", if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5133 : If the "app.support.baseURL" preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads "chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul" directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5134 : WebExtensions may use "view-source:" URLs to view local "file:" URL content, as well as content stored in "about:cache", bypassing restrictions that only allow WebExtensions to view specific content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5135 : WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use "browser.tabs.executeScript" to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged "about:" pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5136 : A shared worker created from a "data:" URL in one tab can be shared by another tab with a different origin, bypassing the same-origin policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5137 : A legacy extension's non-contentaccessible, defined resources can be loaded by an arbitrary web page through script. This script does this by using a maliciously crafted path string to reference the resources. Note: this vulnerability does not affect WebExtensions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5138 : A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use. Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
CVE-2018-5140 : Image for moz-icons can be accessed through the "moz-icon:" protocol through script in web content even when otherwise prohibited.

If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5164 : Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the "multipart/x-mixed-replace" MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5165 : In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5166 : WebExtensions can use request redirection and a "filterReponseData" filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5167 : The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display "chrome:" links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display "javascript:" links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5168 : Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the "baseURI" property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.
CVE-2018-5169 : If manipulated hyperlinked text with "chrome:" URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5170 : It is possible to spoof the filename of an attachment and display an arbitrary attachment name. This could lead to a user opening a remote attachment which is a different file type than expected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.
CVE-2018-5172 : The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5173 : The filename appearing in the "Downloads" panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel. Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5174 : In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the "SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI" flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won't prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.
CVE-2018-5175 : A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a "script-src" policy of "'strict-dynamic'". If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the "require.js" library that is part of Firefox's Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5176 : The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including "javascript:" links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as "javascript:" links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5177 : A vulnerability exists in XSLT during number formatting where a negative buffer size may be allocated in some instances, leading to a buffer overflow and crash if it occurs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5178 : A buffer overflow was found during UTF8 to Unicode string conversion within JavaScript with extremely large amounts of data. This vulnerability requires the use of a malicious or vulnerable legacy extension in order to occur. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.
CVE-2018-5180 : A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5181 : If a URL using the "file:" protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the "noopener" keyword. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5182 : If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent "file:" URL. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
CVE-2018-5183 : Mozilla developers backported selected changes in the Skia library. These changes correct memory corruption issues including invalid buffer reads and writes during graphic operations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

CVE-2018-6480 : A type confusion issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2, leading to a memory access violation and a failure of the nonce feature (which, for example, helped with loop prevention). ccnl_fwd_handleInterest assumes that the union member s is of type ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s. However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.

CVE-2018-6550 : Monstra CMS through 3.0.4 has XSS in the title function in plugins/box/pages/pages.plugin.php via a page title to admin/index.php.
CVE-2018-6551 : The malloc implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6), from version 2.24 to 2.26 on powerpc, and only in version 2.26 on i386, did not properly handle malloc calls with arguments close to SIZE_MAX and could return a pointer to a heap region that is smaller than requested, eventually leading to heap corruption.
CVE-2018-6552 : Apport does not properly handle crashes originating from a PID namespace allowing local users to create certain files as root which an attacker could leverage to perform a denial of service via resource exhaustion, possibly gain root privileges, or escape from containers. The is_same_ns() function returns True when /proc/<global pid>/ does not exist in order to indicate that the crash should be handled in the global namespace rather than inside of a container. However, the portion of the data/apport code that decides whether or not to forward a crash to a container does not always replace sys.argv[1] with the value stored in the host_pid variable when /proc/<global pid>/ does not exist which results in the container pid being used in the global namespace. This flaw affects versions 2.20.8-0ubuntu4 through 2.20.9-0ubuntu7, 2.20.7-0ubuntu3.7, 2.20.7-0ubuntu3.8, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.15 through 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.17, and 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.28.

CVE-2018-6851 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x80206040. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant DWORD 0 will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to zero-out the pointer to the security descriptor in the object header of a privileged process or modify the security descriptor itself and run code in the context of a process running as SYSTEM.
CVE-2018-6852 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x80202298. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the nt!memset function is called to zero out contents of a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to zero-out the pointer to the security descriptor in the object header of a privileged process or modify the security descriptor itself and run code in the context of a process running as SYSTEM.
CVE-2018-6853 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x80206024. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where a global variable will be written to a user controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to zero-out the pointer to the security descriptor in the object header of a privileged process or modify the security descriptor itself and run code in the context of a process running as SYSTEM.
CVE-2018-6854 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via multiple IOCTLs, e.g., 0x8810200B, 0x8810200F, 0x8810201B, 0x8810201F, 0x8810202B, 0x8810202F, 0x8810203F, 0x8810204B, 0x88102003, 0x88102007, 0x88102013, 0x88102017, 0x88102027, 0x88102033, 0x88102037, 0x88102043, and 0x88102047. When some conditions in the user-controlled input buffer are not met, the driver writes an error code (0x2000001A) to a user-controlled address. Also, note that all the aforementioned IOCTLs use transfer type METHOD_NEITHER, which means that the I/O manager does not validate any of the supplied pointers and buffer sizes. So, even though the driver checks for input/output buffer sizes, it doesn't validate if the pointers to those buffers are actually valid. So, we can supply a pointer for the output buffer to a kernel address space address, and the error code will be written there. We can take advantage of this condition to modify the SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure of the Token object belonging to the exploit process and grant SE_DEBUG_NAME privilege. This allows the exploit process to interact with higher privileged processes running as SYSTEM and execute code in their security context.
CVE-2018-6855 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x80202014. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant 0xFFFFFFF will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to modify the SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure of the Token object belonging to the exploit process and grant SE_DEBUG_NAME privilege. This allows the exploit process to interact with higher privileged processes running as SYSTEM and execute code in their security context.
CVE-2018-6856 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x8020601C. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where a global variable will be written to a user controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to zero-out the pointer to the security descriptor in the object header of a privileged process or modify the security descriptor itself and run code in the context of a process running as SYSTEM.
CVE-2018-6857 : Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x802022E0. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant 0x12 will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to modify the SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure of the Token object belonging to the exploit process and grant SE_DEBUG_NAME privilege. This allows the exploit process to interact with higher privileged processes running as SYSTEM and execute code in their security context.

CVE-2018-6947 : An uninitialised stack variable in the nxfuse component that is part of the Open Source DokanFS library shipped with NoMachine 6.0.66_2 and earlier allows a local low privileged user to gain elevation of privileges on Windows 7 (32 and 64bit), and denial of service for Windows 8 and 10.
CVE-2018-6948 : In CCN-lite 2, the function ccnl_prefix_to_str_detailed can cause a buffer overflow, when writing a prefix to the buffer buf. The maximal size of the prefix is CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE; the buffer has the size CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE. However, when NFN is enabled, additional characters are written to the buffer (e.g., the "NFN" and "R2C" tags). Therefore, sending an NFN-R2C packet with a prefix of size CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE can cause an overflow of buf inside ccnl_prefix_to_str_detailed.

CVE-2018-7158 : The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.
CVE-2018-7159 : The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.
CVE-2018-7160 : The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.
CVE-2018-7161 : All versions of Node.js 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node server providing an http2 server to crash. This can be accomplished by interacting with the http2 server in a manner that triggers a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer available. This has been addressed by updating the http2 implementation.
CVE-2018-7162 : All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation.
CVE-2018-7164 : Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.
CVE-2018-7166 : ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.  When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.
CVE-2018-7167 : Calling Buffer.fill() or Buffer.alloc() with some parameters can lead to a hang which could result in a Denial of Service. In order to address this vulnerability, the implementations of Buffer.alloc() and Buffer.fill() were updated so that they zero fill instead of hanging in these cases. All versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron"), 8.x (LTS "Carbon"), and 9.x are vulnerable. All versions of Node.js 10.x (Current) are NOT vulnerable.
CVE-2018-7169 : An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.
CVE-2018-7170 : ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.
CVE-2018-7171 : Directory traversal vulnerability in Twonky Server 7.0.11 through 8.5 allows remote attackers to share the contents of arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the contentbase parameter to rpc/set_all.
CVE-2018-7172 : In index.php in WonderCMS before 2.4.1, remote attackers can delete arbitrary files via directory traversal.
CVE-2018-7173 : A large loop in JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg in xpdf 4.00 allows an attacker to cause denial of service via a specific file due to inappropriate decoding.
CVE-2018-7174 : An issue was discovered in xpdf 4.00. An infinite loop in XRef::Xref allows an attacker to cause denial of service because loop detection exists only for tables, not streams.
CVE-2018-7175 : An issue was discovered in xpdf 4.00. A NULL pointer dereference in readCodestream allows an attacker to cause denial of service via a JPX image with zero components.
CVE-2018-7176 : FrontAccounting 2.4.3 suffers from a CSRF flaw, which leads to adding a user account via admin/users.php (aka the "add user" feature of the User Permissions page).
CVE-2018-7177 : SQL Injection exists in the Saxum Numerology 3.0.4 component for Joomla! via the publicid parameter.

CVE-2018-7182 : The ctl_getitem method in ntpd in ntp-4.2.8p6 before 4.2.8p11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted mode 6 packet with a ntpd instance from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10.
CVE-2018-7183 : Buffer overflow in the decodearr function in ntpq in ntp 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging an ntpq query and sending a response with a crafted array.
CVE-2018-7184 : ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7704.
CVE-2018-7185 : The protocol engine in ntp 4.2.6 before 4.2.8p11 allows a remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by continually sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and source IP address of the "other side" of an interleaved association causing the victim ntpd to reset its association.
CVE-2018-7186 : Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s format argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by the gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions.
CVE-2018-7187 : The "go get" implementation in Go 1.9.4, when the -insecure command-line option is used, does not validate the import path (get/vcs.go only checks for "://" anywhere in the string), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site.

CVE-2018-7284 : A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.
CVE-2018-7285 : A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1. The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs and desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec using a different payload number, these desired ones are still stored internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming that a stream of that type would always exist.
CVE-2018-7286 : An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. res_pjsip allows remote authenticated users to crash Asterisk (segmentation fault) by sending a number of SIP INVITE messages on a TCP or TLS connection and then suddenly closing the connection.

CVE-2018-7311 : ** DISPUTED ** PrivateVPN 2.0.31 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The software installs a privileged helper tool that runs as the root user. This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user. NOTE: the vendor has reportedly indicated that this behavior is "an acceptable part of their software."

CVE-2018-8007 : Apache CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Due to insufficient validation of administrator-supplied configuration settings via the HTTP API, it is possible for a CouchDB administrator user to escalate their privileges to that of the operating system's user that CouchDB runs under, by bypassing the blacklist of configuration settings that are not allowed to be modified via the HTTP API. This privilege escalation effectively allows an existing CouchDB admin user to gain arbitrary remote code execution, bypassing already disclosed CVE-2017-12636. Mitigation: All users should upgrade to CouchDB releases 1.7.2 or 2.1.2.
CVE-2018-8008 : Apache Storm version 1.0.6 and earlier, 1.2.1 and earlier, and version 1.1.2 and earlier expose an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.
CVE-2018-8010 : This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.
CVE-2018-8011 : By specially crafting HTTP requests, the mod_md challenge handler would dereference a NULL pointer and cause the child process to segfault. This could be used to DoS the server. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.33).
CVE-2018-8012 : No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum in Apache ZooKeeper before 3.4.10, and 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.3-beta. As a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.
CVE-2018-8013 : In Apache Batik 1.x before 1.10, when deserializing subclass of `AbstractDocument`, the class takes a string from the inputStream as the class name which then use it to call the no-arg constructor of the class. Fix was to check the class type before calling newInstance in deserialization.
CVE-2018-8014 : The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.8, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, 7.0.41 to 7.0.88 are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue.
CVE-2018-8015 : In Apache ORC 1.0.0 to 1.4.3 a malformed ORC file can trigger an endlessly recursive function call in the C++ or Java parser. The impact of this bug is most likely denial-of-service against software that uses the ORC file parser. With the C++ parser, the stack overflow might possibly corrupt the stack.
CVE-2018-8016 : The default configuration in Apache Cassandra 3.8 through 3.11.1 binds an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via an RMI request.

It has been fixed in versions: 1.2.6.1, 1.3.2.1, 1.4.5, 2.0.1.
CVE-2018-8026 : This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.4 and 7.0.0 to 7.3.1 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (currency.xml, enumsConfig.xml referred from schema.xml, TIKA parsecontext config file). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. The manipulated files can be uploaded as configsets using Solr's API, allowing to exploit that vulnerability.

CVE-2018-8038 : Versions of Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.4 do not fully disable Document Type Declarations (DTDs) when either parsing the Identity Provider response in the application plugins, or in the Identity Provider itself when parsing certain XML-based parameters.
CVE-2018-8039 : It is possible to configure Apache CXF to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation via 'System.setProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs", "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol");'. When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the HostnameVerifier work with the old com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface. However, the default HostnameVerifier implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface, and an exception is thrown. However, in Apache CXF prior to 3.2.5 and 3.1.16 the exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly propagated. What this means is that if you are using the com.sun.net.ssl stack with CXF, an error with TLS hostname verification will not be thrown, leaving a CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

CVE-2018-8710 : A remote code execution issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 2.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The plugin implemented a page redraw AJAX function accessible to anyone without any authentication. WordPress shortcode markup in the "shortcode" parameters would be evaluated. Normally unauthenticated users can't evaluate shortcodes as they are often sensitive.
CVE-2018-8711 : A local file inclusion issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 2.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion attack.
CVE-2018-8712 : An issue was discovered in Webmin 1.840 and 1.880 when the default Yes setting of "Can view any file as a log file" is enabled. As a result of weak default configuration settings, limited users have full access rights to the underlying Unix system files, allowing the user to read sensitive data from the local system (using Local File Include) such as the '/etc/shadow' file via a "GET /syslog/save_log.cgi?view=1&file=/etc/shadow" request.
CVE-2018-8714 : Honeywell MatrikonOPC OPC Controller before 5.1.0.0 allows local users to transfer arbitrary files from a host computer and consequently obtain sensitive information via vectors related to MSXML libraries.
CVE-2018-8715 : The Embedthis HTTP library, and Appweb versions before 7.0.3, have a logic flaw related to the authCondition function in http/httpLib.c. With a forged HTTP request, it is possible to bypass authentication for the form and digest login types.

CVE-2018-8897 : A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual (SDM) was mishandled in the development of some or all operating-system kernels, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in Windows, macOS, some Xen configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it occurs.

CVE-2018-9105 : NordVPN 3.3.10 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from its privileged helper tool's implemented XPC service. This XPC service is responsible for receiving and processing new OpenVPN connection requests from the main application. Unfortunately this XPC service is not protected, which allows arbitrary applications to connect and send it XPC messages. An attacker can send a crafted XPC message to the privileged helper tool requesting it make a new OpenVPN connection. Because he or she controls the contents of the XPC message, the attacker can specify the location of the openvpn executable, which could point to something malicious they control located on disk. Without validation of the openvpn executable, this will give the attacker code execution in the context of the privileged helper tool.
